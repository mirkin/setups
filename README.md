## About
I'm running various Linux distros other than my main Fedora machine along with OSX. I use a variety of frameworks, environments, and languages. I'll often switch back to an OS, Editor, Language combination I've not used for a while and I'm all fingers and thumbs forgetting how to do the simplest of tasks.

This is a repo if set up instructions for new installs along with reminders on how to do various tasks and use common programs and systems.
